# ROSproject
This is a ROS project from Politecnico course "Robotics".

It consists of a bag file containing the longitude, latitude and altitude of two cars in the Monza circuit.

What I did is convert the data in X, Y and Z coordinates with respect a fixed reference system and I have recreated the path in Rviz 
confirming that the reproduced shape is actually the one of the Monza circuit.

Moreover I handled the parts where GPS signal is lost.
